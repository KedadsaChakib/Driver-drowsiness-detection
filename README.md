# Real-time-driver-drowsiness-detection

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for drowsiness detection using two different approaches: eye-mouth aspect ratio analysis and a custom YOLO model.

### Part 1: Drowsiness Detection using Eyes

- Implemented using OpenCV and dlib for facial landmark detection.
- Monitors the eye aspect ratio to detect drowsiness based on blink patterns.

### Part 2: Drowsiness Detection using YOLO Custom Model

- Utilizes YOLOv5 for real-time object detection.
- Trains a custom YOLO model to detect drowsiness-related behaviors.
